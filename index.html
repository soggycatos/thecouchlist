<h1>Welcome to the couch infinity unleashed level list!</h1>
<br><p>This is a level list (owned and made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@realsoggysamurai/videos">soggysamurai</a>) for a friend group Discord server called <b><i>the couch infinity unleashed</i></b> that I just made for fun. This is purely for the friend group Discord server and therefore can only get levels and completions added from people in the friend group. If you're here and not part of the friend group then that is an odd choice, but sure. You can still visit this, just not submit or anything like that.</p>
<br><p>To view the list, click on <b><i>the list</i></b> in the header. Other parts of the list are in the other sections, also accessible via the header.</p>
